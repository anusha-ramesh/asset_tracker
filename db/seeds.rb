# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
    #User.create([{ email: '' }, { encrypted_password: '' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
